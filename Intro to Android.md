<h3 id="architecture-of-android">Architecture of Android</h3>
<p><img src="https://developer.android.com/static/guide/platform/images/android-stack_2x.png" alt="Android Architecture"></p>
<ol>
<li>Linux Kernel:
<ul>
<li>The foundation of Android is built upon the Linux kernel, which provides core system functionalities such as memory management, process management, security, and hardware drivers.</li>
<li>Linux’s stability, security, and open-source nature contribute to the robust foundation of the Android operating system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libraries:
<ul>
<li>Android includes a set of libraries written in C, C++, and other languages.</li>
<li>These libraries provide essential functions and services for various aspects of the operating system, including graphics rendering, data storage, web browsing, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android Runtime (ART):
<ul>
<li>ART is the runtime environment used to execute and run Android applications.</li>
<li>It replaced the earlier Dalvik runtime in Android 5.0 (Lollipop).</li>
<li>ART utilizes ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, converting app bytecode into native machine code during installation, which improves performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application Framework:
<ul>
<li>The Application Framework layer provides a set of high-level abstractions and tools for building Android applications.</li>
<li>It includes essential components such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers, enabling developers to create interactive and modular applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applications:
<ul>
<li>At the top of the Android architecture are the applications themselves.</li>
<li>Android applications are written in Java (or Kotlin) and run within the Android runtime.</li>
<li>The applications interact with the underlying layers of the architecture through well-defined APIs provided by the Application Framework.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Middleware:
<ul>
<li>Middleware components facilitate communication between different layers of the Android architecture.</li>
<li>Key middleware components include the Surface Manager (handling display surfaces), the Telephony Manager (managing telecommunication functions), and the Location Manager (handling location-based services).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):
<ul>
<li>The HAL abstracts the hardware-specific details from the rest of the operating system.</li>
<li>It enables the upper layers of the Android software stack to interact with a variety of hardware components without needing to know the details of each device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux Kernel Drivers:
<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel communicates with the device hardware through hardware-specific drivers.</li>
<li>These drivers enable the kernel to interact with various hardware components such as display drivers, camera modules, sensors, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding the Android architecture is crucial for developers, as it provides insights into how the different layers of the system interact and collaborate to deliver a cohesive user experience. The layered structure allows for modularity, flexibility, and scalability in the development and customization of Android devices.</p>
